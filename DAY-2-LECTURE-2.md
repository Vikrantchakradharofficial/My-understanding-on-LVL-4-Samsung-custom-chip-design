## **Chapter 2: Extracting and Refining Silicon from Sand**

**Q3: How is silicon obtained from sand?**  
Sand (SiO₂) is converted into high-purity silicon through several steps:
1. **Reduction in an Electric Arc Furnace:** Sand is reacted with carbon at high temperatures to produce metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si, ~98% pure).
2. **Chemical Purification (Siemens Process):** MG-Si is converted into trichlorosilane (SiHCl₃) and purified through distillation.
3. **Crystallization (Czochralski Process):** High-purity silicon is melted, and a single-crystal silicon ingot (boule) is grown using a seed crystal.

**Q4: How are silicon wafers manufactured?**  
1. The silicon ingot is sliced into thin wafers using a diamond saw.
2. Wafers are polished, chemically treated, and inspected.
